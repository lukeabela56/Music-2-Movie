# Watching_Audio
Using Librosa and Moviepy, we can watch music!

I take The Explorer's Club's song 'Somebody Made for Me' and use Melspectrograms to create a visual representation. I then stitch these images together and add the video to 'watch the music'. I added my final clip for anyone who'd like to watch.
